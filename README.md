nav-bar Implementation requirements:
Design fidelity: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.

Interactivity:
Links & Icon-buttons: Implement and style interactable components like links and icon buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, and focus.
Buttons: Implement and style buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, and disabled.

Responsive behavior:
Text size: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.

Adaptive hamburger menu: Hamburger menu should be implemented for tablet and mobile views. The menu should be shown once the hamburger icon button is tapped on.
Transition on responsive breakpoints: The transition from full navigation bar on desktop to hamburger menu on tablet and mobile should be fluid and natural, occurring at the appropriate breakpoints for tablet and mobile.

Placeholders: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.

Cross-browser compatibility: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

[Stretch goal] Performance across devices: Ensure that the navigation bar and hamburger performs well on all devices, with quick load times and smooth transitions.

[Stretch goal] Accessibility: Build the navigation bar and hamburger menu with a focus on accessibility, making sure that it complies with WCAG guidelines and provides a fully accessible user experience.
